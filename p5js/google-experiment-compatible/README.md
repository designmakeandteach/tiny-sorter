# Google AI Experiment for Tiny Sorter Compatible Driver 

Lightly modified sketch hosted on [p5js.org](https://editor.p5js.org/designmakeandteach/full/yiTc27eXT)

This sketch fixed the loading of the WebUSB Serial driver in serial.js and also 
cleaned up a few glitches.  I'm intending to maintain this version of the code to 
contribute back to Google if they want it.
