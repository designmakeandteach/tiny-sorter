# tiny-sorter

A fun project that teaches you about AI, electronics, and mechanical engineering. No experience necessary! you will learn how to train a Tensorflow AI model using Google's Teachable Machine to recognize two different categoies of items and build a new machine to sort them. This makes for a great short lesson in a High School level Engineering or Computer Science course. You can make the machine with easy to find reusable parts making it great for the classroom or homescoolers.

See [Design, Make, and Teach](https://designmakeandteach.com/projects/tiny-sorter)
for instructions for how to incorporate tiny-sorter into your lesson plans!

## Materials 

Other than paper, tape, and scissors, you will need a PC or laptop with a webcam, a microprocessor compatible with Circuit Python or the Arduino environment, a micro servo, and some jumper wires to connect them together. We recommend [Adafruit](https://adafruit.com) for their tutorials and the products needed to complete the project.

## History 
This builds from the [Tiny Sorter](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/tiny-sorter) Google Experiment launched in 2019 to combine Teachable Machine
with an Arduino.  It has been updated to modernize the logic to work in
recent releases of the Chrome browser and more microprocessors and environments.
